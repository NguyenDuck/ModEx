# We know why you're here.

ModExpedite is a TypeScript framework completely modular to write Minecraft Bedrock Add-Ons at the speed of light.

Aren't you tired of having to repeat lots of JSON in your Minecraft Add-Ons? ModExpedite is here to solve that problem for you once and for all.

The ModExpedite framework is shipped with a bunch of functionalities that will help you achieve whatever you want, no matter how custom it is. This is made through a series of concepts:

- Generators: TypeScript classes that generate files and puts them in your Add-On.
- Factories: TypeScript classes that fill the generators with data.
- Plugins: TypeScript classes that go inside the factories and automate tasks like adding the repetitive code.

You will learn more about this below, but first, lets create a project.

# Prerequisites

This project runs with Bun, so the only thing needed here is to have [Bun installed.](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

# Super Easy Installation

```bash
bunx modexpedite
```

Thats it, the console will then ask you for some information about your Add-On.

# Start a project

Inside your folder generated by the `bux modexpedite` command, run the following command from terminal:

```bash
bun start
```

The project will start and the ModExpedite compiler will be listening to changes. Each time you do a change to the `index.ts` file, the project will re-compile.

# Add a block

Adding blocks is simple. First, create a BlockFactory object in your `index.ts`. Underneath, factories are objects that will create a "generator" of certain type. Remember a generator is just a piece of code that writes a file into your Add-On.

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { BlockBasicTexturePlugin, BlockFactory, modExCore } from 'modexpedite';
import './modexpedite.config';

new BlockFactory({
  name: 'test_block',
  plugins: [],
});

modExCore.getInstance().build(); // Command to start the build process
```

Now an empty block will be created. But who wants an empty block? No one. Lets add textures:

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { BlockBasicTexturePlugin, BlockFactory, modExCore } from 'modexpedite';
import './modexpedite.config';

new BlockFactory({
  name: 'test_block',
  plugins: [
    new BlockBasicTexturePlugin({
      texture: 'block',
    }),
  ],
});

modExCore.getInstance().build(); // Command to start the build process
```

We are adding a plugin to the BlockFactory that automatically handles all the block texture creation and edits the necessary files to add a texture to our block.

Now on your root folder go to the "assets" folder and put inside texture called "block.png".

Save the file and it will produce a Minecraft Bedrock block.

# Make your own plugin

Its super easy to design your own plugins and get them to work repeatedly. For example, in a new file:

```ts
export class BlockCollisionBoxPlugin extends BasePlugin<BlockGenerator> {
  async run(block: BlockGenerator): Promise<void> {
    // This will modify a block and add a 1x1x1 collision component
    block.blockBehavior['minecraft:block'].components[
      'minecraft:collision_box'
    ] = {
      origin: [0, 0, 0],
      size: [1, 1, 1],
    };
  }
}
```

Now, to add this plugin simply do:

```ts
import { BlockCollisionBoxPlugin } from 'your-plugin-file';

new BlockFactory({
  name: 'test_block',
  plugins: [
    new BlockBasicTexturePlugin({
      texture: 'block',
    }),
    new BlockCollisionBoxPlugin(), // That easy

    // You can even run plugins without creating classes like so:
    {
      async run(obj) {
        obj.blockBehavior['minecraft:block'].components[
          'minecraft:display_name'
        ] = 'A block';
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Doing the previous steps, you can end up with a block JSON file that looks like this:

```json
{
  "format_version": "1.19.40",
  "minecraft:block": {
    "description": {
      "identifier": "company_project:test_block"
    },
    "components": {
      "minecraft:geometry": {
        "identifier": "minecraft:geometry.full_block"
      },
      "minecraft:material_instances": {
        "*": {
          "texture": "b_test_block"
        }
      },
      "minecraft:display_name": "A block"
    }
  }
}
```

# Thats it! This is work in progress...

Altough due to the framework architecture, this is completely modular and you can create your own generators, factories and modules.
